### iOS

https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios

The Stripe Terminal iOS SDK is compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 and above.

#### Info.plist
Add the correct permissions:

    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Location access is required in order to accept payments.</string>

    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers.</string>

This one might no longer be needed on 3.4.0+
https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios/releases/tag/3.4.0

    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Bluetooth access is required in order to connect to supported bluetooth card readers.</string>


Add background modes (optional):

    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>bluetooth-central</string>
    </array>

### Breaking changes with v3.5.0+
`SCPBluetoothReaderDelegate` methods generated by ObjectiveSharpie were all overloads of `Reader()`. This was not intuitive so they have been renamed to be more specific.

### Breaking changes with v3.8.1+
Several configurations that use the builder pattern were changed to read-only so the setters were removed.
